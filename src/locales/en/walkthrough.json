  "step1Title": "You receive 3 ballots",
  "step1Text": "In the municipal election, you receive three different ballots: for the City Council (the \"Römer\"), for the local council of your district, and – if you are an EU citizen – for the Municipal Foreigners' Advisory Council (KAV).",
  "step2Title": "{{count}} votes – as many seats as are being filled",
  "step2Text": "For this ballot, you have exactly {{count}} votes. You can distribute all {{count}} votes freely among candidates of all parties.",
  "step3Title": "Strategy 1: Vote for an entire list",
  "step3Text": "If you trust a party, simply check the list header. Then all candidates on that list receive one vote each, from top to bottom, until your {{count}} votes are used up.",
  "step4Title": "Strike candidates",
  "step4Text": "If you've checked a list, you can strike individual candidates: click on the name – that candidate will no longer receive a vote. The freed-up vote automatically goes to the next non-struck candidate.",
  "step5Title": "Strategy 2: Cumulate (stack votes)",
  "step5Text": "You can give a single candidate up to 3 votes – this is called \"cumulating\". This way you strengthen your favourites.",
  "step6Title": "Strategy 3: Split votes across parties",
  "step6Text": "You can distribute your votes among candidates of different parties – this is called \"splitting\" (panaschieren). Pick the best candidates from all lists!",
  "step7Title": "Strategy 4: Combine",
  "step7Text": "You can check a list AND give individual votes to candidates from other parties. Your remaining votes then flow into the checked list: its candidates receive one additional vote each from top to bottom, until all {{count}} votes are distributed.",
  "step8Title": "Caution: This makes your ballot invalid",
  "step8Text": "Your ballot is invalid if you cast more than {{count}} votes, check more than one list, or give a candidate more than 3 votes. Watch the counter at the top!",
  "step9Title": "Try it out!",
  "step9Text": "Try it yourself with the interactive ballot above. Don't worry – you can't make any mistakes here!",
  "step10Title": "Share & Print",
  "step10Text": "When you're done, you can share your selections as a link or print a cheat sheet to take with you to the polling station!",
